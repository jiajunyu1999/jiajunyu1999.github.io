## Welcome to My World!  

Hi there! I‚Äôm Jiajun Yu (‰ΩôÂÆ∂È™è), a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at Zhejiang University, proudly supervised by [Haishuai Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/haishuaiwang). My research focuses on the exciting intersections of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Drug Discovery ‚Äîwhere cutting-edge AI meets the future of healthcare.  

I am currently in joint training at the **Shanghai Innovation Institute**.  

Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I completed my Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Technology at China Agricultural University (CAU), where I worked under the mentorship of Associate Professor [Lu Jia](https://faculty.cau.edu.cn/jl/list.htm).
